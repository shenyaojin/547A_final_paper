	abstract = {The saturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil can be predicted using empirical relationships, capillary models, statistical models, and hydraulic radius theories. A well-known relationship between permeability and the properties of pores was proposed by Kozeny and later modified by Carman. The resulting equation is largely known as the Kozeny–Carman (KC) equation, although the two authors never published together. In the geotechnical literature, there is a large consensus that the KC equation applies to sands but not to clays. This view, however, is supported only by partial demonstration. This paper evaluates the background and the validity of the KC equation using laboratory permeability tests. Test results were taken from publications that provided all of the information needed to make a prediction: void ratio, and, either the measured specific surface for cohesive soils, or the gradation curve for noncohesive soils. The paper shows how to estimate the specific surface of a noncohesive soil from its gradation curve. The results presented here show that, as a general rule, the KC equation predicts fairly well the saturated hydraulic conductivity of most soils. Many of the observed discrepancies can be related to either practical reasons (e.g., inaccurate specific surface value; steady flow not reached; unsaturated specimens, etc.) or theoretical reasons (some water is motionless; hydraulic conductivity of soils is anisotropic). These issues are discussed in relation to the predictive capabilities of the KC equation.},

The results of laboratory experiments, available in the database (terrigenous reservoirs with permeability in the range from 12 to 1132 md), are used to train the neural network, and then to predict the reservoir permeability.

              Laboratory studies of several factors affecting measurements of relativepermeability were made using the three-section plastic-covered core technique.Results show that the core assembly, properly constructed, will perform as asingle unit, and that the testing technique will, under suitable conditions ofpressure gradient, gas expansion, and migration of partial water saturation, permit measurement of flow characteristics not affected by technique.Wettability equilibrium is readily established in cores exhibiting strongwetting preference to water or oil when initially saturated with water.Laboratory tests must be conducted so that saturation changes represent thosethat occur in the reservoir. Immediate implications of saturation history arethat the possibility exists of increasing the displacement efficiency ofsolution gas drive reservoirs over the natural process, andresidual gassaturations following water flooding in gas or gas condensate reservoirs willbe 15 to 50 per cent pore space rather than 1 to 11 per cent as generallybelieved.
              
                Introduction
                Solutions of petroleum reservoir problems pertaining to productionperformance require the use of true relative permeability characteristics. Thisrelationship of fluid conductivity and saturation has been obtained byreservoir engineers in four ways, namely:From past gross reservoir performance and the extrapolation of this databased on experience,By using published fluid flow relationships obtained in laboratory studieson general type porous materials,By attempting a mathematical derivation of flow behavior, using someexperimentally obtained characteristics of reservoir rocks, andBy laboratory flow tests using representative rock samples of areservoir.
                The first three methods listed above have shortcomings which make their uselimited or questionable. Production characteristics of only certain processesare obtained from field data and these are not available at the beginning of areservoir's producing life, at which time they are desirable. It is fortuitousif general fluid flow characteristics obtained experimentally have accurateapplication to specific field problems. Also, it is felt that at this timethere is not sufficient knowledge of the flow behavior of oil, water, and gasin porous materials to enable applicable analytical description of this to bemade based on other measured rock characteristics.
                Measurement of relative permeability in the laboratory offers the only directmethod subject to adequate checking for determination of flow characteristicsapplicable to field problems. Primarily, this paper deals with laboratoryexperiments to establish the effects of several factors on the measurement ofrelative permeability and the practical significance of this knowledge.

	abstract = {Various processes such as heterogeneous reactions or bioﬁlm growth alter a porous medium’s underlying geometric structure. This signiﬁcantly affects its hydrodynamic parameters, in particular the medium’s effective permeability. An accurate, quantitative description of the permeability is, however, essential for predictive ﬂow and transport modeling. Wellestablished relations such as the Kozeny–Carman equation or power law approaches including ﬁtting parameters relate the porous medium’s porosity to a scalar permeability coefﬁcient. Opposed to this, upscaling methods directly enable calculating the full, potentially anisotropic, permeability tensor. As input, only the geometric information in terms of a representative elementary volume is needed. To compute the porosity–permeability relations, supplementary cell problems must be solved numerically on this volume and their solutions must be integrated. We apply this approach to provide easy-to-use quantitative porosity–permeability relations that are based on representative single grain, platy, blocky, prismatic soil structures, porous networks, and real geometries obtained from CT-data. As a discretization method, we use discontinuous Galerkin method on structured grids. To make the relations explicit, interpolation of the obtained data is used. We compare the outcome with the wellestablished relations and investigate the ranges of the validity. From our investigations, we conclude whether Kozeny–Carman-type or power law-type porosity–permeability relations are more reasonable for various prototypic representative elementary volumes. Finally, we investigate the impact of a microporous solid matrix onto the permeability.},

All pore space is divided into interparticle (intergrain and intercrystal) and vuggy pores. In nonvuggy carbonate rocks, permeability and capillary properties can be described in terms of particle size, sorting, and interparticle porosity (total porosity minus vuggy porosity). Particle size and sorting in limestones can be described using a modified Dunham approach, classifying packstone as grain dominated or mud dominated, depending on the presence or absence of intergrain pore space. To describe particle size and sorting in dolostones, dolomite crystal size must be added to the modified Dunham terminology. Larger dolomite crystal size improves petrophysical properties in mud-dominated fabrics, whereas variations in dolomite crystal size have little effect on the petrophysical properties of grain-dominated fabrics.},

Three more series of floods were conducted in Berea cores for the same three crude oils used in the previous set. Each of the coreflood series involved three cycles of water and miscible gasfloods, with each cycle consisting of the steps necessary to cover the range of saturations from connate water to miscible flood residual oil saturation (ROS). The results from these flow tests revealed that the oil/water relative permeabilities, saturations, and oil recoveries can be significantly different from cycle to cycle, indicating alterations in the in-situ wettability caused by miscible flooding. These wettability alterations had a significant positive effect on the miscible flood oil recoveries in the case of intermediate-wet and oil-wet reservoirs, while their influence in a strongly water-wet reservoir was negligible. In some cases, a mixed-wettability condition developed as a result of miscible flooding, resulting in higher subsequent waterflood oil recoveries. The water/oil relative permeability ratios have been used to identify the development of mixed-wettability in cores.},
